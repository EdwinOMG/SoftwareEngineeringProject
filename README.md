This project will focus on the computation "Square Digit Chains". The computation generates a sequence of numbers by repeatedly replacing a number with the sum of the squares of its digits until it reaches the sum of 1 or 89. Once it reaches one or the other it will be in a loop.

Example 1: 
Input: 44
Output: 44(4^2 + 4^2) -> 32(3^2 + 2^2) -> 13 -> 10 -> 1 -> 1

Example 2:
Input: 85
Output> 85 -> 89 -> 145 -> 42 -> 20 -> 4 -> 16 -> 37 -> 58 -> 89
